/*
Prompt:
Write a program that dynamically resize an array to a bigger size. 
The program creates an array of an arbitrary size (specified by the user). 
Then the user may extend the array to a bigger size (this involves creating a temporary 
array with larger size, copying the values of the elements, and adding new values into 
the extension cells). 
Print the new array to the user to confirm the functionality.
