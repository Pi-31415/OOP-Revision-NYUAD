# OOP-Revision-NYUAD

This is my revision for C++ and other OOP languages for my University courses.

I am using g++ for compiling. If using bash, please run the following to compile.

```
cd foldername
clear && g++ filename.cpp -o outputname && ./outputname
```

such as 

```
clear && g++ lab3_example6c.cpp -o lab3_example6c && ./lab3_example6c
```
